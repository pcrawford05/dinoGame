Project I built over the summer using my EE109 project kit (Thank you Prof. Weber for lending it to me so I could build cool things like this).
It was a lot of fun reviewing concepts from EE 109 like interrupts, EEPROM, and PWM. I tried to use as many of the concepts that I knew in this project and very much enjoyed it.
